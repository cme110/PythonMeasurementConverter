# Python Measurement Converter
This measurement converter currently can convert between temperatures, lengths, masses, times, speeds, angles, areas, digital storages, pressures and frequencies, and can be used in a Python terminal by running measurement_converter.py or in a GUI by running gui.py. I will add more types of measurements to the project in the future.
