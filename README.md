# Python Measurement Converter
This measurement converter currently can convert between units of temperature, length, mass, time, speed, angle, area, digital storage, energy, pressure and frequency, and can be used in a Python terminal by running measurement_converter.py or in a GUI by running gui.py. I will add more types of measurements to the project in the future.
